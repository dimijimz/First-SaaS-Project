## Overview

RoamX is a prototype for an integrated management system that leverages artificial intelligence to help mobile businesses operate more efficiently. The core components of RoamX include:

- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login using JWT.
- **Order Management:** Create, track, and manage orders easily.
- **AI-Driven Demand Forecasting:** A machine learning model (currently a dummy model) predicts customer demand based on factors such as weather, local events, and historical trends.
- **Route Optimization (Planned):** A placeholder endpoint to integrate real-time mapping (Google Maps/Mapbox) for optimal routing.
- **Third-Party Integrations (Future):** Planned support for notification (Twilio, SendGrid) and payment APIs (Stripe, Square).
